# Lightbox-phts

This is a fork of [the original Lightbox 2.7.1](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2).

## Improvements

### v1.0.0

* Refactored in order to be able to set custom options and initialize `Lightbox` inside your code anywhere you need.
* Fixed image blicking during change especially when fade durations are small.
  Introduced a new option: `hideImageDuringChange`.
* Added options to tune more fade durations:
    - `loaderFadeDuration`
    - `imageFadeDuration`
    - `detailsFadeDuration`
* New feature: previews. Previous and next clickable image previews are shown.
    - Related options:
        - `showPreviews` - turns on/off the feature;
        - `overridePreviewsPosition` (values: "center") - if specified then the script overrides the previews position and ignores CSS.
    - Use element data attr `data-lightbox-thumbnail` to specify thumbnail image for a preview.
* Trigger events:
    - `lightbox.changed` on image change;
    - `lightbox.closed` on lightbox close.
* Disabled closing on image/loader click.
* Dropped support of `rel` attrs.
* EXPERIMENTAL: Added support of Youtube embedded videos.
